# My Dum Aloo Adventure

This repository is a testament to my love for Dum Aloo and my slightly unorthodox habit of storing food images on GitHub.

## The Making of the Dum Aloo

*boil and peel baby patatoes then fry them. take fresh curd fix spieces in curd like kashmiri mirch, corriender poweder , turmeric,, salt*
*treat this curd paste as tamato purry fry and after enough heating add kashturi methi and corriender leafs and enjou* 

## Why GitHub, you ask?

*  Because why not? 
*  Maybe one day, AI will analyze food images directly from code repositories. Who knows!
